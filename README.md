# kiss-validate
a simple validator for input fields, focused for electron apps

# Version
0.0.1 at the moment. 

# Aim and Direction
The project is aimed towards creating a simple javascript plugin to use for validation of input fields. I started this to include it with my electron based app, as all other javascript libraries were overbloated and apparently unoptimized.

# Does it use jQuery?
Currently, the plan is to run it in pure javascript

# Example Syntax
Example syntax is like:
  `<input type="number" value="123" />`
  
or
  
  `<input type="text" t="number" value="123" />`
  
### Under consideration:
 
  `<input type="text" number value="123" />`
  
or 
  
  `<input type="text" number="number" value="123" />`
